            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Letter, or Declaration now read from His Sacred Majeſtie, expreſſing His Princely Care, and tender Affection towards the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and all His Majeſties Loyall and Dutifull Subjects is now to be taken into our conſideration: And I verily believe there is none here preſent, but hath as tender care and dutifull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards his royall Majeſtie and the preſervation of His Honour and Dignity, the Lawes and Religions eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in His Majeſties Dominions, Parliaments, and their juſt rights and priviledges as any Subjects to any Prince in the whole Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>No man Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I think, doubted, or had the leaſt thought of jealouſie, that are true Proteſtants and loyall ſubjects of his Majeſties ſincerity and integrity towards his Liege people: for wee have ſenſibly felt and underſtood His cleare intentions, and gracious meaning to us all, not onely theſe, but his Princely impreſſions in this his gracious

Letter and Declaration, but alſo by former Speeches, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and Proteſtations both publick and private, his willing and cheerefull granting us from time to time our juſt deſires and requeſts, and his cheerefull paſſing of many wholſome Acts, and Lawes for the good of this Kingdome, and the redreſſing of many grievances &amp; opreſſions which his good Subjects did ſuffer by groaning under the burthen of them, and his willing complying with his Parliament for the appeaſing of the great differences that was between this kingdome and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the ſetling of peace and unity amongſt our ſelves: Theſe have beene ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Princely and tender care over his people, and enough to endeare our hearts and affections to his Royall Majeſty, and his poſterity for ever.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Theſe propoſitions recommended by his Majeſty, to the conſideration of the Houſe, conſiſts of theſe Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The upholding and maintaining of His Majeſties juſt and Regall authority, and ſetling of his Revenue.</item>
               <item>2. The eſtabliſhing of the liberties of the Subject in the free and quiet enjoying of their eſtates and fortunes, the liberties of their perſons, the ſecurity of true Religion now profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſetling of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in ſuch a manner as may take away all juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, it hath been our principall care and endevours hitherto, as farre as the preſent diſtempers and diſtractions in the State would give us leave, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the juſt Prerogative, and Regall power of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to ſettle his revenue: But being neceſſitated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and conſider of the greater and weightier affaires of this State, being ſo perplexed and diſtracted through the malice and pernitious endevours of wicked and diſaffected perſons, to the peace and tranquillity both of his Majeſty, and his Kingdomes, thereby forced to lay aſide the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Majeſties demand, till his Majeſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes bee ſecured and preſerved from fatall deſtruction;

which by the malignant adverſaries thereof, daily ſought and practiſed: But not leaving the ſame either as negligent, or forgetfull of his Majeſties juſt demand, or in any unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, but that in due time, upon the firſt oportunity to take the ſame againe into conſideration, and proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the finall Concluſion thereof; deſiring this Houſe, that His Majeſty may be informed of our reall intentions therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the other propoſition by his Majeſty wee cannot but in dutifull obedience returne our thankefulneſſe to his Majeſty in the name of the whole Parlament for his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care of our Liberties and Priviledges and pious reſolution to eſtabliſh our Religion; in its truth and purity, and his indifferency in the uſe and exerciſe of Ceremonies, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which wee have received many Petitions from divers Counties and parts of this Kingdome Signed with many thouſand hands for the utter aboliſhment of the ſame, ſhewing likewiſe the inconvenience in the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the ſame, the great dammage and many evills that have ſucceeded upon the tolleration thereof hitherto; which with the continuance of the uſe thereof is alſo like to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the evils, and daily encreaſe more and more dangerous, upon which it hath beene thought fit by this Honourable Houſe to extinguiſh and aboliſh the ſame forme being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the worſhip of God in the exerciſo of Religion by the generall vote of the Houſe, and divers orders have iſſued through the Kingdome for leaving of, and laying by the further uſe thereof; Theſe things being thus farre procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in by joynt conſent of Parliaments, I humbly deſire his Majeſty may be moved by Petition of both Houſes for his royall aſſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>And for the ſetling of Religion and good Diſcipline in the Church. We have beene much oppoſed and interrupted in our proceedings therein, when we had the ſame in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation and in conſideration, by the Prelats and prelatical faction in the Lords Houſe; having been a great part of our buſineſſe to remove ſuch impediments as have hindred our

            <p>And thus much concerning his Majeſties propoſitions, which I deſire may bee taken into preſent conſideration, and anſwer reformed to his Majeſty concerning the ſame.</p>
